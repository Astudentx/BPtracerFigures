# BP-Tracer R Code Repository

This repository contains the curated R code and processed data used to generate the figures and key analyses for the **BP-Tracer** study. The aim is to provide a transparent and reproducible workflow for reviewers and other researchers.

## Repository overview

The repository is organized as a **figure-oriented** and **analysis-oriented** collection of R Markdown scripts and their associated processed data. In short:

- Each `*UP.Rmd` script corresponds to one or several analyses and/or figures in the manuscript.
- Processed `.RData` objects provide the input needed to run these scripts without requiring all original raw data.
- Output figures (PDF) can be regenerated from these scripts.
